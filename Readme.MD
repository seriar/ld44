The game is about turning a barren and hostile planet to life. 

The goal of the game is to survive and turn the planet to new Eden Garden.

But this requires a sacrifice. Resources are scarce. Player must bread the 
engineered lifeform, which is used to sustain the player and allow the growth 
and further terraforming.

GoL is the base mechanics. The player starts with a field of 20x20, and few cells.
Player should sow the cells on the field and allow it to grow. 

### Victory:
To win the game all fields must be terraformed (unlocked)

### Defeat:
Game over when no cells are left. To delay it player may harvest existing fields

### Drain:
Each cycle costs something - e.g.
* 1-1000: 100 turns cost 1
* 1001-10000: 100 costs 2
* 10001-100000: 100 costs 4
* 100001-1000000: 100 costs 8

### Sowing:
* Player must have a field
* Player defines where to put alive cells
* Cost of cells grows (i^2/2)

### Growing:
* After sowing is done growth begins on basic Conveys GOL rules 
* Player can stop the growth (costs?) 
* Player can harvest living cells
* If cell is created outside of the borders it becomes an income
* Plot ages (the older the more it costs?)

* Player can run many plots at same time (and it is beneficial)
